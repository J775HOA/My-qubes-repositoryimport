# Qubes VPN configuration
# =======================
#
# Place your VPN configuration in this file.  This progam will take care
# of placing the configuration in the right location for you.
#
# If your OpenVPN configuration refers to other files, such as credentials,
# add them to the folder containing this file.  To refer to those additional
# files, a relative path is enough, since the OpenVPN daemon changes its
# working directory to the folder containing this file, prior to starting up.
#
# Once you are done editing the configuration, save this file and
# close the editor.  The VPN service will start automatically.
#
# Problems? Refer to the README.md file included in this program for
# troubleshooting instructions and issue reporting information.
#
# Ensure that your OpenVPN server sends a default gateway.  This gateway
# will be automatically used as the default route for the VMs that use
# this VPN VM as NetVM.
#
# Here is a sample configuration file.  Note how it refers to a file
# qubes-vpn.creds that must be created by you in the same directory.
